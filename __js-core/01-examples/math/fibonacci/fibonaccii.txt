----[ The Fibonacci sequence ]------------

The Fibonacci sequence is defined by , for all , when and . 
In other words, to get the next term in the sequence, add the two previous terms. 
The notation that we will use to represent the Fibonacci sequence is as follows: 
f1=1,f2=1,f3=2,f4=3,f5=5,f6=8,f7=13,f8=21,f9=34,f10=55,f11=89,f12=144


1 + 1 = 2
    1 + 2 = 3
        2 + 3 = 5
            3 + 5 = 8 
                5 + 8 = 13
                    8 + 13 = 21
